LocalLibrary Mozilla tutorial on express framework

This website is the result of following the MDN learning area's tutorial on the Express framework. Using MongoDB (w/ Mongoose) and Pug, the website allows for basic CRUD operations on several data models including authors, genres, books, and specific copies of books in a library.

I have also extended the tutorial implementation to include secure user registration, limited-attempt log in, log out, account deletion, and restricted access to CRUD functionality using express-sessions, mongo-connect, and bcrypt.
